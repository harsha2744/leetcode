An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.
Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
solution:

class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        
        t2 = t3 = t5 = 0
        k = [0] * n
        k[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            k[i] = min(k[t2] * 2, k[t3] * 3, k[t5] * 5)
            
            if k[i] == k[t2] * 2:
                t2 += 1
            if k[i] == k[t3] * 3:
                t3 += 1
            if k[i] == k[t5] * 5:
                t5 += 1
        
        return k[-1]
